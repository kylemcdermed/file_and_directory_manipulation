1️⃣ Directory Creation:
I successfully created both logs and backup_logs directories, 
ensuring I had a clear organization structure.

2️⃣ File Movement:
The program did not move logs.csv to logs because the file didn’t exist. 
If I had that file in my working directory, it would have moved just fine

3️⃣ File Deletion:
successfully deleted the sample.txt file, which was inside my directory
